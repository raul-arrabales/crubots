<p>
This is a modified version of the sample Explorer program provided by Microsoft.
It demonstrates how to make a robot explore its environment using
a laser range finder (LRF) and build a map as it goes.
The code has been changed so that it will work
with the simulated Pioneer 3DX robot.
NO HARDWARE IS REQUIRED! (If somebody wants to try it with a real
Pioneer robot and let me know, that would be great. I can't afford
a Pioneer 3DX with LRF!)
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> This program requires an updated version of the 
<a href="../DifferentialDriveTT/DiffDrive.htm">Simulated Differential Drive</a>
that supports the DriveDistance and RotateDegrees APIs.
Consequently, it also needs a slightly modified version
of the <a href="../MazeSimulator/MazeSimulator.htm">Maze Simulator</a>.
The manifest specifies my modified version of the Dashboard, although
this can be changed to use the Simple Dashboard included
in the MSRS distribution.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Microsoft provides a program called Explorer in the directory
&lt;MSRS&gt;samples\Misc\Explorer. However, it uses two functions
that were not supported in the Simulated Differential Drive until
V1.5 and therefore it could not be run in the simulator. This was
a serious disadvantage for beginners hoping to learn about laser range
finders and autonomous exploration.
</p>
<p>
I therefore updated the Simulated Differential Drive code
so that to implement the DriveDistance and RotateDegrees functions.
However, you should note that these functions do not produce exact
motions because in the simulator the robot moves in small steps
that depend on the motor speed. It therefore tends to step past
the desired position, i.e. turn too far and drive too far. (In the
real world, robots never do exactly what you tell them,
so in a sense this is realistic.)
</p>
<p>
A screen shot of the program in operation is shown below.
Notice that you can view the robot's camera in a separate window
and the Dashboard shows a top-down map based on the laser range data.
The Global Map window is not shown in this diagram.

</p>
<p>
In order to get the Explorer program to work, you have to use several different projects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>ExplorerSim</li>
<li>Simulated Differential Drive TT</li>
<li>Maze Simulator</li>
<li>Dashboard</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is an integrated set of programs. You must use only the
versions available on this page. If you mix older versions of these
projects then the Explorer will not work.
To make it easier to install, all of these projects are supplied
in a single ZIP file.</p>


<h3>What it does</h3>
<p>
Basically, the ExplorerSim program controls a simulated Pioneer 3DX robot which
has a laser range finder on top of it. The laser range finder is used
to determine the direction of the most free space, and
the robot heads off in this direction. You will see it stop and
&quot;look around&quot; from time to time.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the exploration algorithm is not ideal. (I did not write
it, so don't blame me! I will provide better algorithms in later
programs.) The robot
will often return to areas it has previously explored (because
it does not use the map that it builds)
and sometimes it will oscillate from side to side trying to decide
where to go next. Much more work would need to be done to use this
program for real exploration. However, it does illustrate many
points about exploring and how to use a laser range finder. It is
certainly better than my basic Intro program which relies on
bumpers because in the Explorer the robot does not run into walls!
</p>
<p>
As the robot wanders around, it builds a map of what it sees
with the LRF. This is displayed in a separate window:<br />
<img src="Images/Map-Counting.gif" vspace="5" hspace="5" /><br />
Note that the map is not used for exploration in this version
of the program. A future program will demonstrate how to
incorporate the map into an exploration algorithm.
</p>
<p>
Three different methods have been implemented for constructing the
map: Overwrite, Counting and Bayes Rule. The results however are
very similar. See the <a href="ExplorerDocumentation.htm">Documentation page</a>
for more details.
</p>
<p>
Note that this is a simulation, so the robot always knows
exactly where it is. Therefore it creates quite good maps.
This is not the case in the real world because the robot
has to estimate its position.
</p>

<h2>Available Resources</h2>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
A <a href="ExplorerDocumentation.htm">Documentation page</a> is provided with
instructions on how to install and run the program.
These web pages are also included in the ZIP file so you don't have to go back
to the Internet all the time.
You should also read the <a href="readme.txt">readme.txt</a> which is included in the ZIP file.
</p>
<h3>Tutorial</h3>
<p>
There is a brief <a href="ExplorerTutorial.htm">Tutorial</a>.
However, it does not explain the program in detail. You can use
the software without having to make any changes to the code. You should
try the Microsoft Simulation Tutorials on which this program is based.
</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>This software might be developed further. 
This version was built with V1.5 it will not work with other versions.<br />
<a href="http://sky.fit.qut.edu.au/~taylort2/MSRS/Downloads/QUTJul2007.zip">QUT MSRS Apps</a> 18-Jul-2007<br />
<br />
You must unzip the file into your MSRS root directory. It will not
overwrite any of the Microsoft code. All the services are located
in the Apps\QUT directory under the MSRS root. Please read the
installation instructions on the <a href="ExplorerDocumentation.htm">Documentation page</a> carefully.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, you need the Microsoft Robotics Studio software as well.
At present this must be version 1.5.
</p>

<h2>Legal Stuff</h2>
<p>
This code is based very heavily on the Microsoft Explorer sample
program. It is not warranted to be
suitable for any purpose other than playing around with MSRS. There
are known bugs, and it is not intended as a definitive example of
how to write robotic systems. If you use it on a real Pioneer
robot and your robot crashes into walls, that's too bad -- change
the code!
