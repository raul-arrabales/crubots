Maze Simulator - Development Notes

Open in VS
Go to project properties

Change Output path in Build
Change Post-Build Events in Build Events
Change Start External Program and Working Directory in Debug
Change Reference Paths
Change Signing. Had to browse, and when I selected the file, it was
copied into project directory.

MSR\bin\services created on C:. How? Just opening the project?

Post-build exited with error code 3, but message flashed up too fast
to see.

Offending command cannot be executed directly in a DOS window:
"D:\Microsoft Robotics Studio (August 2006)\bin\dssproxy.exe" /dll:"$(TargetPath)"
/proxyprojectpath:"$(ProjectDir)Proxy "
/keyfile:"D:\Microsoft Robotics Studio (August 2006)\samples\mrisamples.snk"
/binpath:". " @(ReferencePath->'/referencepath:"%(RootDir)%(Directory) "', ' ')

However, a proxy appears to have been created.

Started VS using devenv command from a MRS DOS window.
Then it worked :-(
OK, so you can't start VS from Windows Explorer ... VS needs some
environment variables defined.

Manifest was not copied to config directory. Should it be?
There are no instructions for running the service. Presumably
you are supposed to know how!

Extracted info from the debug section of Project Properties:
D:\Microsoft Robotics Studio (August 2006)\bin\dsshost.exe -port:50000 -tcpport:50001 -manifest:"MazeSimulator/MazeSimulator.manifest.xml"

Seems to have the wrong manifest directory, but still won't run in the debugger.

dsshost.exe -port:50000 -tcpport:50001 -manifest:"samples/MazeSimulator/MazeSimulator.manifest.xml"
Says invalid manifest identifier. Maybe a version problem?

Nope, just have to be in the root of the MRS when you run dsshost.exe.
Seems that it uses the current directory as the default.

Had to change the filename in the code because it had the wrong path too.

Office looks great.

Pressed F3 to make the camera solid and blew the office apart!!!
Then ran into a wall and it shot off into the never-never. Gravity
does not seem to have any effect because there was one wall floating
in space.

Dashboard starts automatically, but you still have to know the damn
port number!
It is 50001 which is the tcpport command line parameter.

See manifest. There is an additional service record:
<ServiceRecordType>
	<dssp:Contract>http://schemas.microsoft.com/robotics/2006/01/simpledashboard.html</dssp:Contract>
</ServiceRecordType>

Robot would not drive -- started to tilt up in the air. So I ran into
it using the camera (with F3 turned on) and it tumbled off into space.
G key has no effect. What is going on with Gravity?

Worked on the code to add height based on pixel colour.
Also improved the optimization code so that it would create
large rectangle rather than ones just one row wide.

When I had finished all this, gravity worked. Dunno why.

24-Aug-2006:
Posted the code on the Internet, added a post to the original
in Channel 9, and notified Ben Axelrod via e-mail.


Decided to try to set the colour of the blocks as well.

How can you create a simple coloured block like in VRML or OpenGL?
Material properties? Or apply a bitmap texture to a surface?

Posted a question to the Newsgroup.

Reply from George suggesting I look at MaterialAdvanceProperties
and MaterialOpticalProperties.

You can examine classes in VS by typing the name of the class
into the code window and then using Go to Definition in the
context menu. VS uses reflection to extract the property and
method definitions. If the programmer has done the right thing,
then there are also comments explaining how to use the methods.

After much messing around and tearing of hair, I had some code
that I thought would set the colour. However, it did not work.

Posted another question to the Newsgroup.

George replied that these classes are for the Phyics sim,
not the Visual entities. Bum steer.

Anyway, I had figured out how to use simple textures in the
meantime. It is really simple:
Create a bitmap (I made them 16x16 so I could see what I was
doing)
Save the bitmap into the MRS\store\media directory
For the entity, i.e. BoxShape called box, just add:
box.State.Assets.DefaultTexture = "bitmapname.bmp";

So the Maze Simulator now has a "Lego-like" appearance!
Pretty cool, even if I do say so myself.


----------------------------------------------------------------

Simulation Tutorial 1

Started VS from command line.
Compiled.
Started in debugger.
All OK. The Project Properties were correct - must be edited
by the installation script.

RoboticsCommon.dll is in bin\services and there is a reference
in the project.

Note that the Robotics Tutorial 6 shows this as a project in
the Solution, but it does not exist. (Posting in newsgroup.)

Textures have to be in store\media, e.g. sky.dds.


----------------------------------------------------------------

Simulation Tutorial 2

Press F3 to make the camera solid. However, if you run into the
robot, it tips over! Way too much "oomph!"

Create a dashboard:
bin\dsshost /port:51000 /tcpport:51001 /manifest:"config\SimpleDashboard.manifest.xml"

Simulation was on 50001.

Added a dashboad to the manifest.

The command in the tutorial is wrong -- has an extra slash after tcpport.
This one is correct:

bin\dsshost /port:50000 /tcpport:50001 /manifest:"config\SimulationTutorial2.manifest.xml"

Can get a list of the currently running services:
http://fit10012645:50000/directory


----------------------------------------------------------------

Service Tutorial 1

The created files are M08, not M06.

Using the command line in the doco to run the service is wrong -- it runs the old
service because the new manifest is not in the config directory.

Class StateType is actually ServiceTutorial1State
An instance called _state is automatically created by dssnewservice.

ServiceTutorial1Service in Control Panel, not ServiceTutorial1.
JavaScript error when I dropped the service, but it appeared to work
after refreshing the screen. However, it was still running in the DOS
window. Probably because the node is still running, but the service
has stopped.




----------------------------------------------------------------

Using the Simulator

Rotating with the mouse is really hard.

Also, every time I start, the mouse seems back to front. Needt to be able to flip it.

Need a "set me horizontal" button. With a horizon, you can move it to the
middle but in an "office" you can't see the horizon. Besides, even a small
error adds up over a long distance and you end up going through the floor or
floating in mid-air.

Add a camera to the Pioneer!!! How can you:
Create a new camera
Set camera properties, i.e. FOV, pixel resolution, etc.
Get the camera image

Posted a message to the Newsgroup with these suggestions.



----------------------------------------------------------------

Dashboard

How about passing it parameters, or adding to a manifest, to allow
it to automatically pick up the host and port? Then you would not
have to mess around finding the right port.



----------------------------------------------------------------

September 2006 CTP update

Converted the code using the tool supplied.

Migrated most of the variables to the State class so that they
can be set using a config file (Initial State). This is where
they should have been in the first place, but the first version
was just "quick and dirty".

Added a small amount of additional code to allow for the use of
either defined colors (using RGB) or textures. The Textures will
override the RGB values.
