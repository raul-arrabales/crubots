MazeSimulator - October CTP Update

Had to remove and re-add the references.

Some of the namespaces have changed. See the code.

DiffuseColor is now a Vector4. Needed to change code in two places
where the Wall Color was assigned. Also, have to add W component.

Nothing appeared initially because I forgot to copy the config file
and the textures to the store. However, an empty config was created
and there were error messages about the missing texture files in the
VS Output window.

There is no robot! However I can connect to the drive in Dashboard.
The mesh was missing because .x files are no longer used. (There was
an error message in the Output window.)

Robot orientation is incorrect. Same in the Microsoft Tutorial2.
The problem is that the coordinate system for the Simulation has
changed, but there is actually no way to change the orientation
of the robot when it is created.

Overall colour is darker now.
Pure colours are however much brighter.
The coordinate system has changed, so the viewpoint is now looking
in the reverse direction. Need to change the code in several places
to negate the Z coords.

Still does not seem to be a rotate key in the Simulation :-(

All the help info and data (position, fps, etc) have disappeared.
None of the F keys seem to do much except F2 (physics).

Increased the number of colours to 16 and changed the colour mapping
code accordingly.

Added MassMap to allow the mass of objects to be changed.

Added UseSphere flags so that spherical objects can be used.

Updated the State to contain all the new info.
