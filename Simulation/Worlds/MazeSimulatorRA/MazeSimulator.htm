<p>
The original idea (and code) for the Maze Simulator came from Ben Axelrod
and was posted on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=226071">Channel 9</a>.
</p>
<p>
I have modified the code so that you can have coloured walls and they
can also be of different heights. The program only supports 16 different
colours (or textures), but this is sufficient to give it that wonderful 
"Lego-like" quality that seems so appropriate for a simulated maze.
</p>
<p>
In addition, in the October version of the program I added the capability
to create spheres, i.e. balls, that the robot can push around. Unfortunately,
these balls will not bounce off the walls. I have been unable to find the
"magic" commands required to make a ball bounce properly
despite a couple of postings to the Discussion Forum.
</p>
<p>
And for the Version 1.0 release of Microsoft Robotics Studio, the December
version of the Maze Simulator allows you to select either the Pioneer 3DX robot
(with a camera mounted on top) or the Lego NXT by changing the RobotType in the
configuration file.
</p>
<p>
The Maze Simulator is probably now nearing the end of its useful life. There is
not much point in adding extra features because it will become too complicated,
which defeats the purpose of the original exercise, i.e. to get you up and
running quickly in a simulated, but interesting, environment.

<h2>Available Resources</h2>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
A <a href="MazeSimulatorDocumentation.htm">Documentation page</a> is provided with
instructions on how to run the program.
All of these web pages are included in the ZIP file so you don't have to go back
to the Internet all the time.
You should also read the <a href="readme.txt">readme.txt</a> which is included in the ZIP file.
</p>
<h3>Tutorial</h3>
<p>
There is a brief <a href="MazeSimulatorTutorial.htm">Tutorial</a>.
However, it does not explain the program in detail. You can use
the software without having to make any changes to the code. You should
try the Microsoft Simulation Tutorials on which this program is based.
</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The software is available via the following links:<br />
<a href="http://sky.fit.qut.edu.au/~taylort2/MSRS/Downloads/QUTJul2007.zip">QUT MSRS Apps</a> 18-Jul-2007<br />
This version was built with the version 1.5 release of MSRS.<br />
Please read the <a href="readme.txt">readme.txt</a> for installation instructions.<br />
</p>
<p>
See also the <a href="../Intro/Intro.htm">Intro to Autonomous Robotics</a> program that uses the Maze Simulator.
</p>

<h2>Legal Stuff</h2>
<p>
This code is based very heavily on the Microsoft MSRS Tutorials
and feedback from the MSRS developers. It is not warranted to be
suitable for any purpose other than playing around with MSRS. There
are known bugs, and it is not intended as a definitive example of
how to write robotic systems or simulation systems.
